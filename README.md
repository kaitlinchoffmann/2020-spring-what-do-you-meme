## Introduce Yourself

Hi, I’m Kaitlin Hoffmann. I did my B.S. at Queens College for Nutrition and Dietetics because I originally wanted to be a 
Registered Dietitian. After graduating, I worked as a cook/kitchen supervisor in a nursing home and was later hired as a 
Dietetic Technician at another nursing home. It was here that I realized this was not what I wanted to do and instead of 
going to an internship to be eligible to become a dietician, I went to New Paltz for computer science instead. Here at New 
Paltz, I have taken Programming and Data Structures, Computer Systems, Database Design, Database Management, Data Analytics, 
E-Business Systems and Introduction to Machine Learning. I am currently taking Web Server Programming and Introduction to 
Cybersecurity. I was also a TA for CPS 210 and 310 Labs last semester, and am currently a TA for CPS 210 labs. For our final 
in Data Analytics, we had to “give insights” about the property values in Manhattan. We were allowed to create any 
visualizations we wanted so I used Circle Packing (click on the circles to see the effect): http://rpubs.com/kaitlinhoffmann87/512129 
For E-Business Systems, I created a website for a fictitious e-business for a clothing company that sold clothes with pictures
of my cats on them: https://cs.newpaltz.edu/e/b-f19-06/cgi-bin/

I really enjoy web development and am leaning towards becoming a web developer once I graduate,
however I am not one hundred percent sure. After this course, I am hoping it helps me decide 
what I want to do. I asked a past student who got a computer science related job while in school
what course helped and prepared her the most for her job, and she quickly said Web Server 
Programming. My E-Business project was extremely beneficial in learning how to create a complete
application, front-end and back-end. However, we were told to keep things simple so my website 
does not utilize any frameworks. Regardless if I specifically use Node.js or Vue.js in the 
future, I will most likely be dealing with some type of framework that this course will help me 
understand how to utilize. If I end up in web development, I also see myself using JavaScript A 
LOT which this course will help me learn since I used very little JavaScript in E-Business.
